# TODO

## Demo Setup

1. [x] Get a working image gallery in twentyfourteen
2. [x] Write tests for image nav in QUnit
3. [ ] Run those tests in Grunt
4. [x] Write an async test
5. [ ] Write a basic JS function test
6. [ ] *Optional: Run the tests in Karma?*

## Note from Brian

> Having seen you present on other complex things in the past, I have every confidence that you'll do great :)
> 
> If it helps, your presentation really only needs to sufficiently explain these four things:
> 
> 1. How can I get tests running locally?
> 2. What are some handy utility functions the testing library provides (e.g. assertTrue, assertSame, etc)?
> 3. How do I write my first test?
> 4. How do I run a test?
> 
> For items #1 and #2, you can outsource this entire portion to another well-written guide or presentation. The real important stuff for Saturday's viewers are #3 and #4. I'd be extremely pleased if for #3 you took just a simple function that did anything and showed me how to write a good test for it. Bonus points if it is a function that would benefit from two different tests :)
> 
> John's presentation covers some basics like what constitutes a well-written, testable function. But, if you want to include that in your presentation, too, it can only help to underscore the importance of writing good code first :)
> 
> Hope this helps, man!
